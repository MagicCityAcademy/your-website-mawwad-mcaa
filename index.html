      <p>I am a recent adult that's obsessed with computers,
        this side is just a journey about finding out all about computers
      </p>
      <p>I think computers are just the best thing ever made in the whole wide world, next to sliced bread</p>

      <pre>Right now I'm saving up for a Ryzen 7 5700/5800X3D, it's the fastest gaming CPU for AM4 <br>
      and while it is decently expensive, it's completely worth the upgrade 
      because your bottleneck will only be your GPU</pre>
